## Part 2: Theoretical Questions

Answer the following questions with detailed explanations:

### Question 1: NAT vs No NAT

**What is the difference between having NAT and not having NAT in a network?**

**Requirements:**

- Explain what NAT (Network Address Translation) is
- Describe scenarios where NAT is used
- Compare networks with NAT vs without NAT
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages of using NAT
- Include examples of:
  - Private IP address ranges
  - Public IP address usage
  - IP address conservation
  - Security implications

### Question 2: Dynamic Source NAT vs PAT

**What is the difference between Dynamic Source NAT and PAT (Port Address Translation)?**

**Requirements:**

- Define **Dynamic Source NAT** (many-to-many NAT)
- Define **PAT** (Port Address Translation / NAT Overload)
- Explain how each method works
- Compare the two approaches:
  - Number of public IP addresses required
  - Number of internal hosts supported
  - Translation mechanisms
  - Use cases for each
- Provide examples and diagrams if possible
- Explain the role of port numbers in PAT
